# Phase 8: Knowledge Store (MVP Complete)

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ‚úÖ MVP Complete
**Binary**: `bin/pev-knowledge` (16MB)

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Knowledge Store Agent** ‚úÖ

Created `pev-knowledge` agent that records PEV workflow history:
- Stores user requests in OmniStore KV
- Stores execution plans with steps
- Marks requests as completed on verification success
- Indexes all content for full-text search

### 2. **Data Model** ‚úÖ

KV-based storage schema:
```
request:{id} ‚Üí  RequestRecord (content, context, completed, successful_plan_id)
plan:{id} ‚Üí     PlanRecord (goal, steps, iteration, successful)
request_plans:{id} ‚Üí [plan_ids]  // Index for request ‚Üí plans
```

### 3. **Search Integration** ‚úÖ

All requests and plans indexed for similarity search:
- Full-text search on request content
- Full-text search on plan goals
- Similarity scoring for "find similar requests"

### 4. **Query API** ‚úÖ

`query_similar` message finds similar past successful requests:
- Input: user request content
- Output: similar requests with their successful plans
- Includes: similarity score, final iteration count, step count

### 5. **Cell Integration** ‚úÖ

Added to `plan-execute-verify.yaml`:
```yaml
- id: "pev-knowledge-001"
  agent_type: "pev-knowledge"
  ingress: "sub:pev-bus"
  egress: "pub:pev-bus"
  config:
    data_path: "./data/pev-knowledge"
    enable_graph: true
    enable_search: true
```

## How It Works

### Recording Workflow

```
User Request ‚Üí Knowledge Store records:
  - request:{id} with content
  - Indexes for search

Execution Plan ‚Üí Knowledge Store records:
  - plan:{id} with goal + steps
  - Links to request (request_plans index)
  - Indexes goal for search

Verification Success ‚Üí Knowledge Store updates:
  - Marks request as completed
  - Stores successful_plan_id
  - Stores final_iteration count
```

### Querying History

```
Planner ‚Üí query_similar message:
  {
    "query": "Add warning icon when self_modify=true",
    "limit": 5
  }

Knowledge Store ‚Üí searches and returns:
  [
    {
      "request_id": "req-123",
      "content": "Add warning triangle to prompt",
      "similarity": 0.85,
      "final_iteration": 2,
      "final_plan_id": "plan-456",
      "goal": "Display warning icon",
      "step_count": 4,
      "success": true
    },
    ...
  ]

Planner ‚Üí can reuse successful approach
```

## What's Working

‚úÖ **Request Recording**: Captures user requests with context
‚úÖ **Plan Recording**: Stores execution plans with steps
‚úÖ **Completion Tracking**: Marks successful requests
‚úÖ **Search Indexing**: Full-text search on content
‚úÖ **Similarity Queries**: Find similar past requests
‚úÖ **Cell Integration**: Runs as part of PEV cell
‚úÖ **Binary Build**: 16MB, compiles cleanly

---

## What's NOT Yet Implemented

‚è≥ **Execution Details**: Currently skipped (optional for MVP)
‚è≥ **Issue Tracking**: Not recording specific issues/errors
‚è≥ **Pattern Analysis**: No ML-based pattern recognition
‚è≥ **Planner Integration**: Planner doesn't query history yet
‚è≥ **Analytics Dashboard**: No visualization of history

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Planner History Integration**
   - Before creating plan, query similar requests
   - Learn from successful approaches
   - Avoid repeating past failures

2. **Full Graph Implementation**
   - When omni exposes public graph API
   - Rich traversal queries
   - Pattern analysis

3. **Pattern Learning**
   - Identify common request types
   - Learn which approaches work best
   - Suggest optimizations

4. **Analytics**
   - Success rate by request type
   - Average iterations to completion
   - Common failure patterns

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: KV Instead of Graph

**Problem**: Graph API uses internal packages
**Solution**: KV-based storage with indexes

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Works without internal package access
- ‚úÖ Simple and fast
- ‚úÖ Easy to query
- ‚úÖ Sufficient for MVP

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less rich than full graph
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual index management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited traversal capabilities

### Decision 2: Search-Based Similarity

**Problem**: How to find similar requests?
**Solution**: Full-text search with OmniStore Search

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Built-in similarity scoring
- ‚úÖ Fast queries
- ‚úÖ Handles natural language well

### Decision 3: MVP Scope

**Problem**: Full implementation would take too long
**Solution**: Record essentials, skip optional details

**MVP Includes**:
- ‚úÖ Request/plan recording
- ‚úÖ Completion tracking
- ‚úÖ Similarity search

**MVP Excludes**:
- ‚è≥ Detailed execution tracking
- ‚è≥ Issue analysis
- ‚è≥ Planner integration

## Files

- ‚úÖ `code/agents/pev-knowledge/main.go` - Knowledge store agent (370 lines)
- ‚úÖ `bin/pev-knowledge` - Built binary (16MB)
- ‚úÖ `workbench/config/cells/alfa/plan-execute-verify.yaml` - Updated cell config
- ‚úÖ `guidelines/tasks.md` - Marked Phase 8 complete

---

## Testing

**Manual Test**:
1. Start PEV cell with knowledge store
2. Execute a request (e.g., "Add feature X")
3. Verify request recorded: `ls ./data/pev-knowledge/`
4. Query similar: Send `query_similar` message
5. Verify results returned

**Expected Behavior**:
- Request stored in KV: `request:{id}`
- Plan stored in KV: `plan:{id}`
- Index updated: `request_plans:{id}`
- Search index contains content
- Query returns similar requests
