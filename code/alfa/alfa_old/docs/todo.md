  - [x] `--memory=512m`
  - [x] Execution timeouts
- [x] Collect stdout/stderr/exit code from sandboxed execution
- [x] Return structured results to AI Layer
- [x] Integration with Tool Dispatcher for `run_command` and `run_tests`

### Streaming Support

- [ ] Implement context persistence options
  - [ ] SQLite backend (alternative to JSON)
  - [ ] Redis backend (for distributed setup)
- [ ] Add context visualization/debugging
  - [ ] Show token usage per message
  - [ ] Display context window utilization

### Advanced Orchestration
- [ ] Multi-turn tool use within single request
  - [ ] Allow AI to chain multiple operations
  - [ ] Implement agentic loops (plan ‚Üí execute ‚Üí verify ‚Üí iterate)
- [ ] Add operation rollback/undo
  - [ ] Track all file modifications
  - [ ] Implement undo stack
  - [ ] Add `undo` command
- [ ] Improve error recovery
  - [ ] Better reprompt strategies
  - [ ] Suggest fixes for common errors
  - [ ] Auto-retry with corrections

### Tool Enhancements
- [ ] Add more tool types
  - [ ] `git` operations (branch, merge, diff)
  - [ ] `lint` code (golangci-lint, eslint, etc.)
  - [ ] `format` code (gofmt, prettier, etc.)
  - [ ] `debug` (set breakpoints, inspect variables)
  - [ ] `profile` (CPU, memory profiling)
- [ ] Improve search functionality
  - [ ] Regex support
  - [ ] Case-insensitive options
  - [ ] Multi-file context search
  - [ ] Semantic code search

  - [ ] Stress tests for context management
- [ ] Add benchmarks
  - [ ] VFS performance
  - [ ] Context retrieval speed
  - [ ] Patch application speed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Automated testing on commit
  - [ ] Release automation

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
  - [ ] Request latency
  - [ ] Token usage
  - [ ] Error rates
- [ ] Add tracing support (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Cost tracking for API usage

### Platform Support
- [ ] Linux audio support (ALSA/PulseAudio)
- [ ] Windows audio support
- [ ] Cross-platform path handling improvements
- [ ] Docker image for containerized deployment

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
- [ ] Single request-response cycle (no multi-turn agentic loops within one request)
- [ ] No streaming support (responses are buffered)
- [ ] Limited context window handling (no smart truncation)
- [ ] No RAG/vector search for large codebases
- [ ] Voice mode requires macOS or Linux (sox dependency)

### Bug Fixes Needed
- [ ] Handle malformed JSON responses from AI more gracefully
- [ ] Improve error messages when API keys are invalid
- [ ] Fix potential race conditions in audio playback
- [ ] Better handling of network timeouts/retries
- [ ] Validate patch operations before applying (prevent corruption)
