This is a sample file for the storage controller demo.

It demonstrates how files are processed by the cell while storage operations
are handled by the external storage controller service.

Key features:
- File ingestion and processing
- Storage integration via HTTP API
- Proper separation of concerns
- Controller pattern implementation

The storage controller runs independently and provides:
- Key-value storage
- Graph database operations
- File storage capabilities
- Full-text search functionality

This architectural pattern ensures scalability, reusability, and maintainability.
