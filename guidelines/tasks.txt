✅ COMPLETED: Configuration Compliance Issue

**Status**: All tasks completed on 2025-10-06

**What was done**:
1. ✅ Created configuration documentation (configuration-conventions.md, config-compliance-report.md)
2. ✅ Fixed bin/alfa - Now fully compliant with standard config resolution
3. ✅ Fixed all 28 agent binaries - Integrated StandardConfigResolver into framework

**Final Implementation** (framework.go:71-191):
- Added --config flag support
- Integrated StandardConfigResolver with 7-level resolution
- Implemented file/support config merging (support wins)
- All agents now compliant automatically via framework

**Test Results**:
- ✅ All resolution levels tested and working
- ✅ Agent framework tests passing
- ✅ Agents can run standalone with config files
- ✅ Backward compatible with orchestrated mode

**Remaining Task** (Low Priority):
- bin/orchestrator - Add AGEN_CONFIG_PATH and AGEN_WORKBENCH_DIR checks
  (Partially compliant - not blocking, can be done later)
