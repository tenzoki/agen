# Projects Directory

This directory contains user projects, each with their own git repository.

Projects are isolated and not tracked in the framework repository.
Each project has its own VCR (Version Control Repository) at: projects/<name>/.git

See: guidelines/references/architecture.md for VCR isolation principles
